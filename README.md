# University-Management-System-ETL-Pipeline

This project is a **complete end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** designed to populate a realistic **University Management System database**. It uses Python to generate synthetic but structured data for students, staff, courses, modules, enrollments, marks, transport, and residential allocations.

The system was built to:

* Simulate real-world university data.
* Practice and demonstrate ETL concepts.
* Prepare for data engineering, backend development, and full‑stack expansion.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ **1. Lookup & Structural Data Auto‑Generation**

The pipeline automatically inserts essential academic structure data such as:

* Levels
* Qualifications
* Departments
* Courses
* Modules

### ✅ **2. Staff Data & Lecturer Assignments**

Randomized staff generation including:

* Lecturers
* Technicians
* Admin
* Security
* Drivers

The script then assigns lecturers to modules.

### ✅ **3. Student Data (5,000 records)**

Generated student fields:

* Student number
* First & last name
* Gender
* Birthdate
* Contact
* Program level, course, department

### ✅ **4. Enrollments & Marks (20,000 each)**

The pipeline assigns each student to multiple modules and generates marks.

### ✅ **5. Residential Data (5,000 records)**

Students are assigned to:

* Residence names
* Room numbers

### ✅ **6. Shuttle System**

Data added for:

* Shuttle pick‑up points
* Bus info
* Bus allocations

### ✅ **7. Applicants Table**

Simulated applicants with:

* Application status
* Intended program
* Demographic data

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### **Python**

Used for generating and loading data.

### **MySQL**

Database for structured storage.

### **Libraries**

* `mysql.connector`
* `random`
* `datetime`

## 🔮 Future Plans (Full‑Stack Expansion)

This project is being expanded into a **full university management platform**. Planned additions:

### 🖥️ **Backend (Python / FastAPI / Flask)**

* REST API for retrieving and updating university data
* Authentication (JWT)
* Role-based access (Admin, Lecturer, Student)

### 🌐 **Frontend (React / Next.js)**

* Student portal (timetable, modules, results)
* Admin dashboard (course & staff management)
* Lecturer portal (upload marks, attendance)

### 📡 **Data Engineering Enhancements**

* Airflow DAG for automated ETL scheduling
* Data quality checks
* Warehouse layer (Star schema)

### 🤖 **AI Integration (Future)**

* AI assistant for students
* Predictive analytics on student performance

---

## 💡 Purpose

This project serves as:

* A portfolio‑ready data engineering project
* A base for backend/full‑stack development
* A learning environment for ETL automation

---

## 📥 Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ETL-University-System.git
```

### 2. Update MySQL Credentials in `tStyle.py`

```
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="your_password",
    database="university_system"
)
```

### 3. Run the Pipeline

```
python tStyle.py
```

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project started as a data‑generation ETL system but is evolving into a full **University Information System** with backend, frontend, and AI features.

It demonstrates strong skills in:

* Database design
* ETL automation
* Python scripting
* Data modeling
* System architecture

And is designed to grow into a production‑ready system.

If you'd like, I can also:
✔ Generate the schema diagram
✔ Create API route maps
✔ Build folder structure for the upcoming backend/frontend
✔ Write a compressed or extended README version
